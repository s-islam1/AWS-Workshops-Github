# üß† Install and Run Ollama on Windows (via PowerShell)

This guide walks you through installing **Ollama** ‚Äî a lightweight local large language model (LLM) runtime ‚Äî directly from **PowerShell** on Windows.  
You‚Äôll download, install, verify, and run a model locally ‚Äî plus create a quick restart alias for PowerShell.

---

## ü™ü Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit)
- PowerShell (Run as **Administrator**)
- Internet connection

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 1: Download Ollama Installer Using `curl`

Run the following command in **PowerShell (Admin)**:

```powershell
curl.exe -L -o "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\OllamaSetup.exe" https://ollama.com/download/OllamaSetup.exe
````

‚úÖ **Explanation:**

* `curl.exe` ‚Üí ensures PowerShell uses the native `curl` binary (not the alias).
* `-L` ‚Üí follows redirects (some URLs redirect internally).
* `-o` ‚Üí saves the file to your Downloads folder.

---

## üìÅ Step 2: Confirm the File Downloaded

Verify the installer exists and check its size:

```powershell
Get-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\OllamaSetup.exe"
```

If you see details like file size and modification time, it downloaded successfully.

---

## ‚ö° Step 3: Launch the Installer

Run the Ollama setup wizard:

```powershell
Start-Process "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\OllamaSetup.exe"
```

Follow the on-screen instructions.
Ollama installs by default to:

```
C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Local\Programs\Ollama
```

---

## üîÅ Step 4: Restart PowerShell (to refresh PATH)

Once the installer finishes, **close and reopen** PowerShell.
Alternatively, you can use this command to automatically restart it as Admin:

```powershell
Start-Process "powershell" -Verb RunAs
exit
```

---

## ‚úÖ Step 5: Verify the Installation

Run:

```powershell
ollama --version
```

You should see something like:

```
ollama version 0.1.32
```

---

## üß© Step 6: Pull and Run a Model

Pull a small, efficient model:

```powershell
ollama pull gemma3:1b
```

Then run it:

```powershell
ollama run gemma3:1b
```

Type any question ‚Äî for example:

```
What is a neural network?
```

To exit, press **Ctrl + C** or type /bye

```
/bye
```



---

## üß∞ Step 7: Create a PowerShell Restart Function and Alias

You can create a helper function to quickly reopen PowerShell in Administrator mode (useful after new installs).

Run:

```powershell
function Restart-PSAdmin { Start-Process "powershell" -Verb RunAs; exit }
Set-Alias restartps Restart-PSAdmin
```

Now, anytime you need to restart PowerShell as Admin, just type:

```powershell
restartps
```

üí° **Tip:** To make this permanent, add those two lines to your PowerShell profile:

```powershell
notepad $PROFILE
```

Paste the lines at the end and save.

---

## üß† Step 8: Summary

You‚Äôve now successfully:

‚úÖ Downloaded Ollama via PowerShell
‚úÖ Installed and verified it
‚úÖ Pulled and ran a local model (`gemma3:1b`)
‚úÖ Created a restart alias for PowerShell

You can now experiment with larger models, integrate Ollama with Python, or connect it to a local web UI like **Open WebUI**.
